<main>
<h4>Q.1.Var vs Let vs Const in Javascript</h4>
<p>The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in JavaScript include:
    Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
    Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are declared.
    Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to the immediate enclosing block.</p>


<h4>Q.2.Arrow vs Regular function in JS</h4>
<p>
    1.The first and most obvious difference between arrow functions and regular functions is their syntax. Not only do they look different, but arrow functions also provide an implicit return shorthand and allow parenthesis around a single argument to be omitted.</p>
</p></br><p>

    2.Regular functions can be used as constructors, using the new keyword. Yet another consequence of the lexical resolution of this inside arrow functions is that they cannot be used as constructors. Using new with an arrow function results in a TypeError.
</p>

<h4>Q.3.Why we use template string in Js?</h4>

<p>Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, for string interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs called tagged templates.</p>
</br>
<p>Example of template string: `string text`</p>
